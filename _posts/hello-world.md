## The Build AWFixer Blog

this is where we will make posts about the things that we are building here at the AWFixer Core Engineering and Development Group. You will find that other subdomains are dedicated to other parts of the AWFixer and Friends businesses, enjoy!

3 of the first posts that we are going to release have to do with the SSO system we are building, Modded Android and AWFixerOS. They are going to be banger posts so keep your eyes peeled for them!
